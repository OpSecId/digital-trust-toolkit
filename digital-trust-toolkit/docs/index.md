## Introduction

Each verifiable credential issued by the BC Government requires governance documents. For guidance with writing governance documentation, use the tools available from [Trust-Over-IP](https://trustoverip.org/our-work/deliverables/) 
The purpose of this repository is to serve as a registry of groups within the BC Government who are "issuers" of verifiable credentials. Creating an entry in this repository will be a requirement for requesting a digital wallet from the BC Government Digital Trust Services.

## Requirements
The [Wiki](https://github.com/bcgov/bc-vcpedia/wiki) contains detailed instructions on what to include and how to submit for review.
