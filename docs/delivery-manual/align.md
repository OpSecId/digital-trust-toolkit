## Overview
The Align Phase initiates the digital trust adoption journey by creating awareness, identifying potential use cases, and assessing readiness. It establishes a foundation of shared understanding and commitment among participants, setting the stage for successful progression through subsequent phases of discovery, trial, and scaling.
## Key Outcomes

1.  **Build Awareness**: Become aware of digital credentials through various channels such as websites, toolkits, or direct outreach. Learn about the potential benefits and applications of digital trust solutions for your organization.
    
2.  **Determine Use Cases**:  
    Participate in collaborative sessions to brainstorm and evaluate potential use cases for your organization. This process helps select and scope a use case that aligns with your needs and capabilities.
    
3.  **Check Readiness**:  
    Evaluate if your organization is prepared to move forward to the discovery phase. This assessment considers factors such as resource availability, organizational alignment, and technical readiness.

## Considerations

-   **Expectation Management:** Ensure clear understanding within your organization about what digital trust can and cannot achieve.
    
-   **Resource Assessment**: Identify potential resource limitations early in the process to avoid surprises later.
    
-   **Scope Definition:** Maintain focus on viable and valuable use cases to prevent project scope from expanding uncontrollably.
    
-   **Internal Alignment:** Ensure key decision-makers and teams within your organization are engaged and supportive from the early stages.
