title: Discover

## Overview
  
In the Discover phase, you'll dive deep into understanding your specific requirements, plan for project delivery, and establish a formal partnership agreement. This phase involves gathering insights, assessing current processes, and preparing for the practical implementation of digital trust solutions.

## Key outcomes

1.  **Understanding and assessing needs**
Identify key actors (Issuers, Verifiers, Holders) and their roles in your digital trust ecosystem. Gain insights into your current state and existing pain points through feedback from these actors.

2.  **Planning for project delivery**
Develop a comprehensive project plan based on onboarding materials and guidance provided. This plan should outline how you\'ll implement the digital trust solution in your specific context.

3.  **Partnership agreement**
Assess your organization\'s capacity and budget for continuing the partnership. Establish a formal agreement to move forward into the trial phase, or identify constraints that may require pausing or adjusting the partnership.
