# Qube Monthly Report Primary Governance Document

# 1. Primary Document

## 1.1. Introduction

This document articulates the digital credential for the Qube Data Report submitted on a monthly basis. 

The development of this documentation follows the governance framework created by the [Trust over IP Foundation (ToIP)](https://trustoverip.org/) [Governance Metamodel Specification](https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/ToIP-Governance-Metamodel-Specification-V1.0-2022-12-21.pdf) created by the [Governance Stack Working Group (GSWG)](https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Governance+Stack+Working+Group).

This governance framework includes structural elements from the Trust over IP Metamodel that were developed by Governance Stack Working Group of the Trust over IP Foundation, the eSSIF Lab Glossary and Mental Models, were contributed to the Trust Over IP Foundation under the CC BY-SA 4.0 license.  There have also been contributions from the Concepts & Terminology Working Group at ToIP, the Human Experience Working Group at ToIP and the Ecosystem Foundry Working Group at ToIP, the work of the Governance Framework Working Group at Sovrin Foundation is also acknowledged in providing support.

## 1.2. Terminology and Notation

[Glossary - General Trust Over IP Terms](https://trustoverip.github.io/toip/glossary)

**Requirements** include any combination of Machine-Testable Requirements and Human-Auditable Requirements. Unless otherwise stated, all Requirements MUST be expressed as defined in [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119).

- Mandates are Requirements that use a MUST, MUST NOT, SHALL, SHALL NOT or REQUIRED keyword.
- Recommendations are Requirements that use a SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, or RECOMMENDED keyword.
- Options are Requirements that use a MAY or OPTIONAL keyword.

**Machine-Testable Requirements** are those with which compliance can be verified using an automated test suite and appropriate scripting or testing software.

**Rules** are Machine-Testable Requirements that are written in a Machine-Readable language and can be processed by a Rules Engine. They are expressed in a structured rules language as specified by the Governance Framework.

**Human-Auditable Requirements** are those with which compliance can only be verified by an audit of people, processes, and procedures.

**Policies** are Human-Auditable Requirements written using standard conformance terminology. The Policies used in the Governance Framework will use the standard terminology detailed in RFC 2119 keywords. Note that all RFC 2119 keywords have weight from an auditing perspective. An implementer MUST explain why a SHOULD or RECOMMENDED requirement was not implemented and SHOULD explain why a MAY requirement was implemented.

**Specifications** are documents containing any combination of Machine-Testable Requirements and Human-Auditable Requirements needed to produce technical interoperability.

## 1.3. Localization

The standard language for this governing framework (GF) is English.
 
## 1.4. Governing Authority

[Qube Technologies (Qube)](https://www.qubeiot.com/) is the governing authority and responsible for developing, maintaining and implementing the Governance Framework. 

## 1.5. Administering Authority

[Energy and Mines Digital Trust (EMDT)](https://digital.gov.bc.ca/case-studies/emdt) is the Administering Authority on behalf of Qube during the pilot phase of development.

The contact information for EMDT is:
* 	**Name:** Kyle Robinson 
* 	**Title:** Senior Strategic Advisor, Digital Trust Ecosystems
* 	**Organization:** Briartech Consulting Inc.
* 	**Email:** [kyle.robinson@briartech.ca](mailto:kyle.robinson@briartech.ca)

## 1.6. Purpose

The purpose of this Governance Framework (GF) is to define the parameters of a Qube Report Credential.  The structure for the credential contains all information needed to fulfill a Qube Report. This credential is issued directly by Qube, which transfers aggregated methane emission volume data based on the time period selected at the site level to the site owner. 

## 1.7. Scope

The GF only covers the Qube Report Credential.

## 1.8. Objectives

This GF describes the Qube Report Credential consisting of data elements captured and included within a Qube Report and as defined by Qube API data elements and standards. A list of these can be found on the Qube Platfrom API (V2.0) https://api.qubeiot.com/index.html. The API allows the retrieval of sites, emissions, measurements and wind data. Qube Technologies seeks to apply meaningful greenhouse gas reduction delivered in three stages (detection, measurement and reduction). This trust framework outlines Qube's issuance of a credential based off of Schemas built from Qube Platform API data referenced above. 

## 1.9. Principles
TBD

## 1.10. General Requirements

A Qube Report Credential MUST be issued by Qube. The API referenced in the Schema Definition section of this document allows the retrieval of sites, emissions, measurements and wind data. The API is a REST based API that returns data in JSON format.
