# BC GHG Emissions Report Verification Statement Credential - DRAFT

# 1. Primary Document

## 1.1. Introduction
This document articulates the governance framework for the BC Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions Report Verification Statement credential. GHG Emissions reporting is required in British Columbia (BC) as per the Greenhouse Gas Industrial Reporting and Control Act, **[GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION REPORTING REGULATION](https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/249_2015)**. 

BC Regulation [249/2015: GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION REPORTING REGULATION](https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/249_2015) sets out reporting requirements that are developed in accordance with various standard setting bodies. Section 33 specifically references the [International Accreditation Forum ((IAF)](https://iaf.nu/en/home/). Other sections within the regulation also refer to provisions being drafted in accordance with the [International Organization for Standardization (ISO)](https://www.iso.org/home.html), [Western Climate Initiative (WCI)](http://westernclimateinitiative.org/) the [Canadian Standards Association (CSA)](https://www.csagroup.org/) and the [National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)](https://www.nist.gov/). 

Current guidelines for reporting are described here: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/climate-change/industry/reporting/verify

The development of this documentation follows the governance framework created by the [Trust over IP Foundation (ToIP)](https://trustoverip.org/) [Governance Metamodel Specification](https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/ToIP-Governance-Metamodel-Specification-V1.0-2022-12-21.pdf) created by the [Governance Stack Working Group (GSWG)](https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Governance+Stack+Working+Group).

## 1.2. Terminology and Notation

[Glossary - General Trust Over IP Terms](https://trustoverip.github.io/toip/glossary)

**Requirements** include any combination of Machine-Testable Requirements and Human-Auditable Requirements. Unless otherwise stated, all Requirements MUST be expressed as defined in [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119).

- Mandates are Requirements that use a MUST, MUST NOT, SHALL, SHALL NOT or REQUIRED keyword.
- Recommendations are Requirements that use a SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, or RECOMMENDED keyword.
- Options are Requirements that use a MAY or OPTIONAL keyword.

**Machine-Testable Requirements** are those with which compliance can be verified using an automated test suite and appropriate scripting or testing software.

**Rules** are Machine-Testable Requirements that are written in a Machine-Readable language and can be processed by a Rules Engine. They are expressed in a structured rules language as specified by the Governance Framework.

**Human-Auditable Requirements** are those with which compliance can only be verified by an audit of people, processes, and procedures.

**Policies** are Human-Auditable Requirements written using standard conformance terminology. The Policies used in the Governance Framework will use the standard terminology detailed in RFC 2119 keywords. Note that all RFC 2119 keywords have weight from an auditing perspective. An implementer MUST explain why a SHOULD or RECOMMENDED requirement was not implemented and SHOULD explain why a MAY requirement was implemented.

**Specifications** are documents containing any combination of Machine-Testable Requirements and Human-Auditable Requirements needed to produce technical interoperability.

## 1.3. Localization

The standard language for this governing framework is American English.
 
## 1.4. Governing Authority

[BC Climate Action Secretariat (CAS)](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/climate-change) is the Governing Authority and party legally responsible for developing, maintaining and implementing the Governance Framework (GF).
The contact for petitioners and relying parties of this GF during the pilot phase of the project is:
* 	**Name:** Kyle Robinson
* 	**Title:** Senior Strategic Advisor, Digital Trust Ecosystems
* 	**Organization:** Briartech Consulting Inc.
* 	**Email:** [kyle.robinson@briartech.ca](mailto:kyle.robinson@briartech.ca)

## 1.5. Administering Authority
[Energy, Mines and Digital Trust (EMDT)](https://digital.gov.bc.ca/case-studies/emdt) is the Administering Authority on behalf of the Tenure and Resource Stewardship Branch during the pilot phase of development.

## 1.6. Purpose

This BC Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions Report Verification Statement credential under the governing authority of CAS reports emissions information as required by the Greenhouse Gas Industrial Reporting and Control Act, [GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION REPORTING REGULATION](https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/249_2015). The purpose of this governance framework is to outline the process associated with governance, issuance, verification, and revocation of a GHG Emissions Report Verification Statement credential. 

## 1.7. Scope

The governance framework only covers the BC GHG Emissions Verification Statement Credential.

## 1.8. Objectives
TBD

_This section states the high-level outcomes desired by the trust community through its adoption of the GF._

1. SHOULD specify tangible, achievable results (e.g. SMART criteria and Fit-for-Purpose criteria).
2. MUST only contain outcomes over which the GF has the authority and mechanisms to achieve within its
scope.
3. MUST be consistent with the principles of the GF (below).

## 1.9. Principles

BC Climate Action Secretariat has identified the following guiding principles in their [Climate Preparedness and Adaptation Strategy 2022-2025](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/environment/climate-change/adaptation/cpas.pdf):

1) Build a Shared Path to Climate Resilience with Indigenous Peoples
2) Take an Equity Informed Approach
3) Enhance Health and Well Being for All 
4) Promote Nature Based Solutions to Enhance Community Resilience
5) Align Emissions Reduction with Climate Adaption 
6) Take a Proactive Approach with a Business Case for Adaptation

## 1.10. General Requirements

When large emitters of CO2 report annual emissions to the [BC Climate Action Secretariat (CAS)](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/climate-change), an Emissions Report Verification Statement must be provided as part of the reporting requirements.
