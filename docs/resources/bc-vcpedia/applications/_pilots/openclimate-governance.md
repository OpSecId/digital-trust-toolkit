# OpenClimate Ecosystem Governance Framework

# Primary Document

## Introduction 

The OpenClimate Verifiable Credentials Ecosystem Governance Framework is a Layer Four Ecosystem Governance Framework of the Trust over IP Foundation (ToIP). The OpenClimate GHG Emissions identifier is used as a key component in building a trust layer for identification and verification of GHG emissions that require accounting. This ecosystem will assist in the development of the OpenClimate Corporate GHG Emissions Reporting Credential Pilot Project. OpenEarth Foundation is a research and deployment non-profit using cutting edge digital technologies and multi-stakeholder collaborations to advance open-source platforms that help increase planetary resilience.

The **OpenClimate Ecosystem**contains structural elements from the Trust over IP Metamodel that were developed by Governance Stack Working Group of the Trust over IP Foundation, the eSSIF Lab Glossary and Mental Models, were contributed to the Trust Over IP Foundation under the CC BY-SA 4.0 license.  There have also been contributions from the Concepts & Terminology Working Group at ToIP, the Human Experience Working Group at ToIP and the Ecosystem Foundry Working Group at ToIP, the work of the Governance Framework Working Group at Sovrin Foundation is also acknowledged in providing support.

## Terminology and Notation 

**ToIP Governance Requirements Glossary**

**Requirements** include any combination of Machine-Testable Requirements and Human-Auditable Requirements. Unless otherwise stated, all Requirements MUST be expressed as defined in RFC 2119.

* Mandates are Requirements that use a MUST, MUST NOT, SHALL, SHALL NOT or REQUIRED keyword.

* Recommendations are Requirements that use a SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, or RECOMMENDED keyword.

* Options are Requirements that use a MAY or OPTIONAL keyword.

**Machine-Testable Requirements** are those with which compliance can be verified using an automated test suite and appropriate scripting or testing software.

**Rules** are Machine-Testable Requirements that are written in a Machine-Readable language and can be processed by a Rules Engine. They are expressed in a structured rules language as specified by the Governance Framework.

**Human-Auditable Requirements** are those with which compliance can only be verified by an audit of people, processes, and procedures.

**Policies** are Human-Auditable Requirements written using standard conformance terminology. The Policies used in the Governance Framework will use the standard terminology detailed in RFC 2119 keywords. Note that all RFC 2119 keywords have weight from an auditing perspective. An implementer MUST explain why a SHOULD or RECOMMENDED requirement was not implemented and SHOULD explain why a MAY requirement was implemented.

**Specifications** are documents containing any combination of Machine-Testable Requirements and Human-Auditable Requirements needed to produce technical interoperability.

## Purpose

The purpose of the OpenClimate Ecosystem Rules is to describe the rules/policies/procedures for verifiable credential exchanges involving Scope 1 GHG Emissions with the OpenClimate Portal. The purpose of the rules is to enable all actors to understand agreed upon standards, terminology and processes that allow the OpenClimate Ecosystem to operate. This will help determine a governing framework and operating model for a global ecosystem that identifies how credentials can be issued, held, and verified by our natural resources business, so that any downstream purchaser, certifier, or financer can be assured of the attested good practices of the BC Industry (in the scope of this pilot) to prove sustainable resourcing.  

## Localization

1)	The official language of the Open Earth GHG Ecosystem Governance Framework SHALL be American English.
2)	The Governance Framework Website SHALL include introductory remakes in the languages of the G20 countries.
3)	For situations in which Open Climate Ecosystem Governance Framework MAY be needed in another language, Open Earth will consider this on a case-by-case basis. 

## Governing Authority 

1)	The OpenEarth Foundation (OEF) as Governing Authority is responsible for the OpenClimate Ecosystem Governance Framework.
2)	The contact information for OpenEarth is:
	- martin@openearth.org
	- joaquin@openearth.org
__________________________
Recommendations for the governing parties in the governance model are contained in the Governance Requirements. This is a controlled document. 


## Purpose

The purpose of the Open Climate Ecosystem Governance Framework is to describe the rules/policies/procedures for Scope 1 GHG Emissions verifiable credential exchanges with the OpenClimate Portal. OpenClimate will be using a subset of content from the Scope 1 GHG Emissions credential called Emissions Presentation Definition v1.0.

## Scope 

The following entities are stakeholders in the Trust Community 

**The OpenEarth - TOIP Rules** apply to all parties who become members of the Open Earth Ecosystem.
 
**OpenEarth**- OpenEarth Foundation is the Governing Authority, a research and deployment non-profit using cutting edge digital technologies and multi-stakeholder collaborations to advance open-source platforms that help increase planetary resilience.

**Credential Issuer**– An organization accredited by OpenEarth to validate company, facility and their related GHG emissions information and register new companies and reference data which are sent to OpenClimate for inclusion in the OpenClimate Independent Emission Inventory.

**Legal Entity** – A legal person or structure that is organized under the laws of any jurisdiction that meet the eligibility criteria for registering for a Scope 1 GHG Emissions credential

**OpenClimate Credential User** – Any user of an OpenClimate GHG credential in any applicable use case. 

**Out of scope** for the OpenClimate Ecosystem Governance Framework are GHG measurements managed by other entities and documents. Although OpenClimate encourages other governance frameworks to make use of the Open Climate Ecosystem Governance Framework for Scope 1 GHG Emissions Credentials, these governance frameworks also are out of scope. 

### Key Roles:
* Validator: The Credential Issuer that validates that the data shared by the company is true according to a certain methodology.
* Company: The legal entity that is reporting their climate data

## Key Processes:

**User and Company Invitation**
-	An organization will be created in the OpenClimate platform 
	-	If the organization already exists in the platform, this step can be skipped
-	A user will be invited into the platform by providing their name and email
-	The user will receive an email to the registered email address with a link that will lead to the issuance of two credentials, a Verified Email Credential and a Verified Employee Credential, to be stored in their Personal Wallet.

**User Identity & Authentication**
-	Will be made up of two separate Verified Credentials (VC) for Personal Identity, a Verified Email Credential and a Verified Employee Credential
	-	The Verified Email Credential MUST be issued by the OpenClimate platform upon invitation of the user
	-	The Verified Employee Credential SHOULD be issued by the Company to which the user belongs, but MAY be issued by the OpenClimate platform
-	Identity VC Storage Location MUST take place on a Personal Wallet with a secure connection. 
-	Verifiable Credential Proof will be requested by the OpenClimate platform for authentication and the proof will be provided by the Personal Digital wallet

**Business Registration & Authentication**

-	Will be made up of a Verified Credential (VC) for BC Business Registration. 
-	VC Storage Location SHOULD take place on a Business Wallet with a secure connection
	-	Some organizations MAY use a Personal Wallet for Emissions VC storage but it is not recommended
-	Verifiable Credential Proof will be requested by the OpenClimate platform and the proof will be provided by the Business or Personal Wallet, linking the Business Wallet to the user

**Emissions presentation**

-	Will be made up of a Verified Credential (VC) for Scope 1 GHG Emissions
-	VC Storage Location SHOULD take place on a Business Wallet with a secure connection that has been already registered in the OpenClimate platform as a user’s linked Business Wallet
	-	Some organizations MAY use a Personal Wallet for Business Registration VC storage but it is not recommended
-	Verifiable Credential Proof MAY be requested by the OpenClimate platform and the proof will be provided by the Business or Personal Wallet
-	Verifiable Credential Proof MAY be presented directly by the Company by sharing a proof presentation to the OpenClimate platform following the correct proof presentation definition
